        <p>My name is Alysha. I earned 3 Bachelor's Degrees from
        Illinois College in Psychology, Spanish, and International
        studies in a period of four years. For my final semester, I 
        studied abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and graduated while
        abroad there in May 2018. Currently, I am in the final stage
        of the Venture for America Fellowship application process.
        I will be interviewing on the 25th of January (this month)
        and then I will be notified whether I will be selected as 
        a 2019 VFA fellow. If selected for the fellowship, I will 
        work with a startup for 2 years and develop the skills and 
        knowledge necessary to start my own company.</p>

        <p>While abroad in Argentina, I noticed the lack of diversity
        in my study abroad program and decided to begin working on
        a project I called Eternal Wanderer. I am in the process of 
        developing a website for the project. The purpose of it is 
        to provide a platform for underrepresented groups of students 
        in study abroad (LGBT+, ethnic-minority, first-generation college 
        students, low-income, and students with disabilities) to share 
        their experiences through blog posts or vlog submissions. Also, 
        it is intended to help address the issue of isolation these 
        students can face abroad by providing an online community for
        them. </p>

        <p>I am passionate about social entrepreneurship and have a
        background and understanding in behavioral psychology, 
        conversational and professional Spanish, usage, marketing,
        Wordpress Web Development, Python, HTML, CSS, content writing,
        economics, world politics, and sociology. I am currently 
        enrolled in a LaunchCode Course to learn the fundamentals of
        Python and Web Development. I am an ambitious self-starter 
        who would like to found my own startup in the future and be 
        a serial social entrepreneur.</p>
